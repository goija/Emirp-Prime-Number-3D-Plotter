# Emirp-Prime-Number-3D-Plotter
Emirp prime numbers are primes that are still primes in both directions you read the digits, for example 13 and 31. This script asks a range between two numbers, and then depending on the version of the script, it prints a list, a 2D plot, or a multithread rendered 3D plot. That last one gives an interesting image on how they are distributed in specific regions of the space.

The term "emirp" itself is simply "prime" spelled backwards, and was coined by the mathematician Earl Irving in 1995. Emirps have been studied by mathematicians for many years, and they continue to be of interest today.

One practical use of emirp numbers is in cryptography, where prime numbers are used extensively in the creation of secure encryption algorithms. Emirps can be used to generate pairs of prime numbers that are distinct from each other, making them potentially useful in cryptography applications.

Emirps are also of interest to recreational mathematicians, who enjoy discovering and studying different types of numbers and number patterns. In addition to generating lists of emirps, mathematicians have also explored other properties of emirps, such as the distribution of their digits and the frequency with which they appear.

Emirps can also be used to create aesthetically pleasing designs and images. For example, by plotting emirp numbers on a graph, one can create patterns that are visually interesting.
